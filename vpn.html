        <h1>Using ProtonVPN</h1>
        <div class="container">
          <p>We will be using our devices in our SIG sessions to practice skills and
            will be using the Internet at times.  We will be using a public WiFi to access the Internet from our SIG
            meeting room; using a VPN service to help us stay safe and secure.
          <p>
            If you are not already using a VPN service, I recommend you adopt a VPN service
            from a company named called <a href="https://proton.me">Proton</a>.  Proton is a
            digital privacy company with a strong reputation of being trustworthy and providing
            quality products.  Proton allows people to use its VPN service for free. (For
            awareness, Proton also offers subscription plans that include its VPN service with
            some additional features that are not available when you use their VPN service
            without a subscription plan; in my opinion, we will not need
            any of those additional features included in their subscription plans for the work
            we do in our SIG sessions.)
          <p>
            ProtonVPN can be used on Apple devices and Windows laptops.  Below you will find links
            to "how to" references that you can use to install and use ProtonVPN on Apple devices.
            I do not have access to a Windows device, so I am not able to create a similar reference
            for Windows.  If you have a Windows laptop that you plan to use in SIG sessions and
            would like help installing ProtonVPN on your device, feel free to contact me; we can
            pick a time/location to meet and set up ProtonVPN on you Windows device.
          </p>
          <h1>"How To" References</h1>
            <p>You have to have an account on Proton's site in order to use ProtonVPN; the
               first reference below leads you through the process to do that. There are a
               couple aspects of creating a proton.me account that I found just "odd"
               enough to possibly cause a problem or two. I have endeavored to write these reference guides
               so that you do not run into those problems. Based on creating my own proton.me account,
               I think you will likely be able to create your own in about 15 minutes.
            </p>
            <p>The second and third references lead you through installing and using ProtonVPN
               on Apple laptops and iPhones/iPads, respectively. I suggest you give yourself
               at least 30 minutes for the first device you install on and try using the
               ProtonVPN on. If you chose to install ProtonVPN on your other devices as well,
               you can probably get that done in about 15 minutes per device.</p>
