            <h2>Types of Sessions</h2>
            <p>
                SIG meetings will be geared to a particular style of learning:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Lab</strong>: The general objective of this type of session is to develop and practice
                    a skills related to using devices through experiential (i.e., "hands on") learning.  The session
                    facilitator will provide exercises and assist others as needed to complete the exercises.
                    Participants need to be able to bring their digital devices with them to these types of sessions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Lecture</strong>: The general objective of this type of session is to increase
                    participants' understanding of select/specific digital technologies.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Discussion</strong>: The general objective this type of session is to explore how
                    select/specific digital technologies impact/influence culture and society.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                In terms of SIG meetings that we schedule during our Spring 2026 term (i.e,. between January 23
                and April 3), the priority will be on Lab and Lecture (with the intention of more Lab and Lecture only
                as needed/desired by the group). In choosing the themes/topics for sessions during the Spring
                2026 term, priority will be on themes/topics covered in the "Tech Skills 101: Driver's Ed for the
                Digital World" course conducted in the Fall 2025 term.
            </p>
            <h2>Structure of Sessions</h2>
            <p>
                OLLI staff has generously reserved a room for this SIG to use every other Friday starting January 23,
                2026.  The room is reserved from 9:00 until noon these days. Participants in the Fall 2026 "Tech Skills
                101" course who are interested in participating in this SIG had a fairly strong "Woah! That's a long time
                for a meeting!" response when I originally shared the room booking dates/time.  Fair enough feedback, so
                I have given some thought to how we get the most out of this time without forcing participants to
                give a full half day of their time to participate in a meeting.
            <p>
                I will plan the content for each meetings chosen theme/topics so that it can be reasonably completed in
                90 minutes (give or take). With the remaining portion of time to help folks one-on-one if any attendees
                want individualized assistance related to the meeting's theme/topics or other issues/challenges they
                would like help with.  I am currently thinking of using the "backend" of our meeting times kind of like
                a college professor's office hours.  I.e., I'll be there to help any SIG member with whatever they would
                like assistance with.  Note, there is an implied "to the best of my ability" related to providing others
                with this type of help.

            <h2>Proposed Sessions</h2>
            <h3 id="files">Files</h3>
                <p>
                    This session's primary aim is to increase participants' proficiency accessing and managing files via
                    hands on exercises.  Exercises will encompass standard/typical tasks we do with our devices' file
                    manager apps, apps that allow you to create/save new files and open existing files, and working
                    with files stored locally on your device's disk drive as well as in a cloud drive.
                <p>
                    <strong><u>Handouts</u></strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="files-explainer.pdf">Explainer</a></li>
                        <li><a href="files-cheat-sheet.pdf">Cheat sheet</a></li>
                        <li><a href="files-exercises.pdf">Exercises</a></li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            <h3 id="ui">User Interfaces</h3>
                <p>
                    This session's primary aim is to increase participants' proficiency "reading the screen." We
                    will review common user interface components (e.g., windows, menus, toolbars, controls, etc.).
                    Exercises will be designed to give you the opportunity to practice identifying user interface
                    components on your screen, understanding what the controls do, as well as using them.
                </p>
            <h3 id="browsers">Browsers</h3>
                <p>
                    Browsers are an important kind of app when it comes using the Internet; it is hard for me to
                    imagine that everyone doesn't use a browser at times. And while all browsers have the same primary
                    purpose (i.e., to visit/view content found on websites on the Internet), they also have common
                    "convenience" features, security features, and privacy features.  In this session we can review
                    what these common features are and do some exercises to familiarize ourselves with how to use them.
                    Some of these common features are
                    <ul>
                        <li>bookmarks</li>
                        <li>search</li>
                        <li>extensions</li>
                        <li>privacy and security</li>
                        <li>syncing</li>
                        <li>profiles</li>
                        <li>history</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>
                    I also think we can review some meaningful user interface concepts while "deep diving" into
                    browsers and doing so could help us better determine if we want to add a session to our
                    schedule to "dive" deeper into general user interface concepts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong><u>Handouts</u></strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="browsers-explainer.pdf">Explainer</a></li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            <h3 id="pwd-mgr">Password Managers</h3>
                <p>
                    During the safety/security sessions in our Fall 2025 course, we spoke very briefly about password
                    managers. I get a lot of value from using a password manager, and want to enable you to do the same.
                    I attempted to limit discussion of password managers in our Fall 2025 course to creating basic/general
                    awareness of them. Like many of the other topics we explored during our Fall 2025, there is more
                    complexity to choosing a password manager and effectively using it than we could reasonably cover
                    in the time we had for our security sessions.
                <p>
                    Apple introduced a password manager app (called "Passwords") with iOS 18 and macOS Sequoia and I started
                    using it more extensively (primarily to experiment with passkeys).  Given we all have at least one
                    Apple device, I believe we can do some worthwhile/interesting exercises using Apple's Passwords app
                    that could help you either start using this app yourself or better enable you start to use some
                    other password manager if Apple's doesn't suite your tastes/needs.
                </p>
            <h2>Safety: Cybersecurity</h2>
                <p>
                    In the Fall 2026 "Tech Skills 101: Tech Skills 101: Driver's Ed for the Digital World" course, we
                    had two sessions on this topic.  The primary objective of this SIG meeting are to practice via
                    lab exercises skills associated with securing our accounts and data. This could include using a
                    password manager, creating strong passwords, using an authenticator app for two factor
                    authentication, and using Apple's advanced cloud security features.
                </p>
            <h3>Settings</h3>
                <p>
                    Settings are an important kind of software feature; they allow you to control/customize how
                    your device and/or your apps. In my experience, it's fairly common for the cause and/or solution
                    to problems we have with our devices to be related--in part if not entirely--to a system or app
                    setting.
                <p>
                    In this session, we will review the myriad available settings and learn how to differentiate between
                    system settings and app settings.
                </p>
            <h2>Safety: Privacy</h2>
                <p>
                    This was an "optional"/"time permitting" topic in the "Tech Skills 101: Driver's Ed for the Digital
                    World" course held during the Fall 2025 term; we were not able to cover this topic during the
                    course due to time constraints.  If members of the SIG are interested, we can add this topic to
                    the SIG schedule.
                </p>
            <h3>Navigating the Internet</h3>
                <p>
                    This was an "optional"/"time permitting" topic in the "Tech Skills 101: Driver's Ed for the Digital
                    World" course held during the Fall 2025 term; we were not able to cover this topic during the
                    course due to time constraints.  If members of the SIG are interested, we can add this topic to
                    the SIG schedule.
                </p>
            <h3>Safety: Well-Being</h3>
                <p>
                    This was an "optional"/"time permitting" topic in the "Tech Skills 101: Driver's Ed for the Digital
                    World" course held during the Fall 2025 term; we were not able to cover this topic during the
                    course due to time constraints.  If members of the SIG are interested, we can add this topic to
                    the SIG schedule.
                </p>
            <h3>The Manual</h3>
                <p>
                    Participants in the "Tech Skills 101: Driver's Ed for the Digital World" course held during the
                    Fall 2025 term expressed a lot of interest in having a single reference (i.e., a book) they could
                    turn to when they needed assistance using their devices.  Unfortunately, there is no single book
                    that explains everything we can do with our devices.  Instead there are many books, and finding
                    the best book(s) for you can be challenging (for a variety of reasons).  Regardless, the passion
                    of folks interest in this kind of reference prompted me to spend time thinking about how "computer
                    geeks" tend to address this kind of need and I think there are some strategies/methods used by
                    "computer geeks" that anyone could learn/practice that fill this need.
                </p>
            <h3 id="email">Email</h3>
                <p>
                    Email is a key feature of the Internet; everyone uses email.  While we briefly touch on email in
                    some session in the Fall 2026 "Tech Skills 101" course, we didn't have a focused discussion on much
                    less any kind of "deep dive."  It may be useful/worthwhile to schedule a SIG meeting on email.
                    Possible topics we could cover in such a session:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>How to manage spam email</li>
                    <li>How to manage the storage space consumed by your email service</li>
                    <li>How to identify/recognize scam email</li>
                    <li>How to use an email app to manage your email (instead of using your browser)</li>
                </ol>
